## 🤝 Code of Conduct

We believe in building thoughtful tools together. To keep our collaboration healthy, we ask all participants to follow these principles:

### Respect First
- Use clear and constructive communication — even under disagreement.
- Credit others fairly. Ask before using someone’s idea in public.

### Contribution Culture
- Complete the Git handshake (see above) to join the lab.
- Once you have access, make your first commit or PR within 14 days.
- Inactivity may result in removal from private repos — no hard feelings.

### Security Mindset
- Don’t leak private code, data, or designs.
- Report any misuse, suspicious behavior, or bugs responsibly.
- Never run unknown code unless you trust the source.

### When It’s Time to Leave
- You can request removal at any time — we’ll part ways respectfully.
- We may rotate inactive users periodically to keep the space focused.

Thank you for helping keep this a purposeful, secure, and respectful place to collaborate.
